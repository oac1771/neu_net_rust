use this to refactor this dirctory
-> want scripts directory to have multiple scripts (hopefully can build binaries independently or atleast be able to build them all)

load mnist data into rust

create benchmark scripts 
try using ndarray instad of current library to compare speed (https://docs.rs/ndarray/0.12.1/ndarray/)

    mninst data label wouldnt only need to be one node with label value
    because ReLu is linear greater than x, so could guess numerical values
